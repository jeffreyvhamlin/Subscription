Smart Subscription & Bill Guardian README
Project Overview
Smart Subscription & Bill Guardian automatically detects subscriptions, EMIs, and recurring bills from bank transactions, predicts cash flow issues, and provides plain-language alerts like "Your Spotify + Prime + Gym will cost ₹4,320 this month. Cancelling Gym saves ₹1,200. Risk of low balance on 26th." It builds on your Jeff Finance experience by adding periodicity detection, forecasting, and notifications.
​
